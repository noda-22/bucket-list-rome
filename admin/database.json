Our contact was Elin, she spoke perfect English and responded very quickly to all our emails, questions and requests. They were genuinely interested in us and in arranging such a fine wedding, and they told us about the different options - everything from an Italian wedding to a civil ceremony in the sign of love.\nThe time before the wedding we had a chat with Elin who took care of everything from ordering a bridal bouquet to arranging violinist, photographer, horse and carriage, make-up artist, wedding dinner, etc. Through Weddings in Rome, we really had the best moment of our lives, together with family and friends.\n",

Around 22.00 in the evening when we left, there were still many who wanted to come in and eat. People around us ordered other dishes such as pasta, tiramisu m.m. and everything looked very good.

I would only do one or the other next time depending on what you prefer to sit or walk around. Definitely more fun than just looking around for more ruins that can get a little boring after a while in Rome.",

            "postDesc": "Well known to many Romans but often missed by tourists, the Magic Door or Porta Alchemica is a gateway into the secretive world of 1600s alchemy. It\u2019s the only one of five remaining doors to marquis Massimiliano Palombara\u2019s original villa. Legend has it that Massimiliano met an alchemist claiming he could use a certain herb to turn metal to gold. The following day the alchemist had vanished leaving behind gold flakes and the \u201crecipe\u201d for his transformation. Massimiliano was unable to read the recipe so inscribed it on his doors, in the hope that someone who could understand it would come knocking. Think you can crack the code? Try your luck and go home a millionaire or at the very least, with a cool photo.",

            "postDesc": "Sure the Vatican is no hidden gem, but imagine being able to stay behind after 6:00 PM when the doors have closed to the public. Picture yourself dining alfresco in the tranquil Cortile del Giardino Quadrato (Courtyard of the Square Garden) under a dusky sky, with spectacular views of the cupola of St Peter\u2019s Basilica and a mouth-watering plate of Italian food in front of you. Now that\u2019s something most tourists in Rome never see.",
